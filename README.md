# openmacro
> [!NOTE]  
> Project is in its early stage of development.

openmacro is a multiplatform personal agent which allows LLMs to run code locally. Open Macro aims to act as a personal agent capable of completing and automating simple to complex tasks autonomously via self prompting.

You can chat with Open Macro through the official desktop application here. Or communicate through the terminal by running `$ macro`.

This provides a natural-language interface and toolset for your computer to:

+ Complete and automate simple to complex tasks.
+ Control a Chromium browser to perform tasks and research.
+ Control desktop applications through vision and pyautogui.
+ Manipulate files including photos, videos, PDFs, etc.

This project is heavily inspired by Open Interpreter.
